            <p>High quality images can take a few seconds to load, even on fast internet connections, but users expect websites to be interactive in much under that.

<p>Every few months I feel the urge to completely redo my personal website from the ground up. Each time it has gotten a little closer to how I want my site to function and how I want it to look. I&#8217;m pretty happy with its current state, however, and I suspect it&#8217;s going to last longer than the rest.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve dabbled in a bit of everything for my site, plain HTML and CSS, templating engines, React, even Google Sites, but nothing was quite right. As it is, my current site is a WordPress site. Now, I know that yes, WordPress is quite old, and yes, PHP has a host of issues, but it&#8217;s pretty awesome for what I want to do with my website.</p>



<p>First of all, it&#8217;s based on blogging and frequent updates, which is something I&#8217;d like to build a habit for. If my website is annoying to update, I probably won&#8217;t do it that often.</p>



<p>Secondly, I have some experience with WordPress templates, from the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="./../../../projects/athletes-for-equal-rights/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Athletes for Equal Rights</a>&nbsp;project. I knew that I could build a template from the ground up to be as bare-bones as possible, reducing the bloat that usually comes with a WordPress site.</p>



<p>Finally, the developer community is large and answers to questions are easy to find.</p>



<p>In terms of its faults, WordPress is likely overkill for my site, especially when it comes to the admin tools and post category system. Of course, it&#8217;s also all compiled on the backend during each server load, which can hurt speeds. I&#8217;m thinking about generating a static version of my site each time I update it and serving that instead, but I&#8217;m not at a point where that would improve speeds enough to justify it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="547" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-26-221914-1024x547.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-849" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-26-221914-1024x547.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-26-221914-300x160.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-26-221914-150x80.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-26-221914-768x410.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-26-221914-1800x961.jpg 1800w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-26-221914-1536x820.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-26-221914.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For the look and feel, I wanted to go as simple as possible, while still being visually interesting. The title section of the site is supposed to feel like the tail end of a URL, with the rest trailing off into the left of the page. In an essence, it&#8217;s like website breadcrumbs, but more decorative than functional. This theme of page titles acting as a part of a URL is also why they are all lowercase across the site.</p>



<p>I wanted simplicity in terms of color as well. Other than in images, the site is all grayscale. I wanted to create a focus on the content itself rather than the site it&#8217;s being presented in.</p>



<p>For the cards that appear on the site, I wanted to keep them as simple as possible, using a slight size and color animation to suggest their clickability.</p>



<p>All in all, I&#8217;m pretty happy with my website as it stands and changes will likely be small tweaks here and there that I notice with it over time.</p>

<p>The NY STEAM BUS aims supplement Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM) education with exciting activities that grow a passion for these subjects. We retrofitted a school bus with floors, cabinets and computers to create the most versatile, mobile classroom. As the technology director, I focused on the initial design and retrofit of the bus and now work to integrate technology into our lessons to teach 21st century skills like programming and engineering.</p>
<p>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we started producing virtual STEAM activities that can be done at home for kids grade K-5. All these activities are public and can be found at our FlipGrid along with student video responses.</p>

            <p>With progress being made on the algorithms side of Resonant, I started looking at how we were going to present our information to a user that is potentially deaf or hard of hearing. The first step was deciding on a form factor. The requirements were pretty simple. Display the source and classification of sound Does [&#8230;]</p>

<p><strong>This project was developed in collaboration with Kalin Kochnev and Jacob Yanoff for the 2021 Senior Division GCRSEF. It received the 3rd Honorable Mention, qualifying for the State STANYS fair.</p>
<p>Check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kalinkochnev/resonant">github here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Recent advancements in machine learning and image processing mean that the ability of computers to see has improved drastically in the last 10 years. While sound is a crucial part of how most people experience their environments, computer hearing has not seen the same advancements. We aimed to develop algorithms to locate audio signals within 3D space as well as classify them into several relevant categories. Additionally, we wanted to convey this information to a user via a wearable device.</p>
<p>The final device uses cross-power spectrum phase analysis to determine the arrival angle of arrival based on two pairs of microphones and displays this information via a heavily modified baseball cap. It uses a small, brim-mounted OLED display to convey positional information to the user. We imagine that potentially, it could be used by a person who is deaf or hard of hearing to better understand their soundscape. The classification algorithm relies on an artificial neural network generated through supervised deep learning. The localization algorithm proved to be highly accurate, with an average error of 2.53% when determining the relative angle of a sound source.</p>
<p>The machine learning algorithm is quite successful at identifying test data, exhibiting 84.6% accuracy, however, overfitting is still present and further optimization is required to make the algorithm applicable to less contrived data. While these algorithms perform well independently, combining their functionality poses a new set of challenges that we hope to address in future research.</p>

<h3>Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://niskyrobotics.club/">niskyrobotics.club</a>&nbsp;for more.</h3>
<p>I am currently the president of the Niskayuna Robotics Club at our high school. Each year we participate in the First Tech Challenge, building a robot to compete in challenges. Our performance at our regional competitions qualified us for the world championship, but that was unfortunately canceled due to COVID-19. Additionally, we are involved in our community, visiting students throughout the year to show them how the topics they learn in school can be applied in the real world to create exciting things.</p>
<p>In addition to building a robot each season, we have to document our work in a comprehensive engineering notebook. This notebook shows the design process from initial brainstorming all the way to final testing and tweaking. No matter how we do each season, we are always immensely proud of the robot and documentation that we create.</p>
</p>
<h3>2019-2020 Season</h3>
<p>From the past season, we learned how important it is for a team to carefully follow the design process. We spent lots of time in the brainstorming and planning phases before we began execution. Additionally, we created an apprentice system for new members to the club to improve our sustainability.</p>
<p>We did well this season and even qualified for the World Championships based on our performance at qualifiers. Unfortunately, the event was canceled because of COVID-19.</p>

<h3>2018-2019 Season</h3>
<p>This season our robot had a very unique design that we managed to execute pretty well, but issues with our electronics were persistent throughout the season and made competition difficult. We qualified to our state event, but definitively could have done better with those electronics issues resolved.</p>
<p>Looking back, I would have spent more time in the beginning steps of the design process. Additionally, we learned the importance of testing before the competition day.</p>

<p>Our Model United Nations club meets every Wednesday where we each represent a country, developing solutions to international problems. As the debate coordinator of the club, I write a background guide for each meeting that describes the issue that we will cover. Additionally, each year we bring a group of 13 to Philadelphia for ILMUNC, an international Model UN conference.</p>
<h3>Background Guides</h3>
<p>These are some of the background guides that I&#8217;ve created for our weekly meetings.</p>

<p><strong>This project was developed in collaboration with Ian Vernooy for the 2020 Senior Division GCRSEF. It received the National Grid and Airforce awards.</strong><br /><strong><br />Find live data from our sensor here:&nbsp;<a href="https://aquametric.menon.pro/">aquametric.menon.pro</a></strong><strong><br />Find project updates and logs here:&nbsp;<a href="https://hackaday.io/project/170881">hackaday.io/project/170881</a></strong></p>
<p>Metrics such as stage height, conductivity, and temperature can provide valuable insight into ecological health and can also serve as predictors for events such as flooding. Traditionally, these metrics are measured either manually by a scientist or by large and expensive permanently installed stations. Unfortunately, human measurement reduces the possible frequency of data collection and traditional sensor stations require lots of infrastructure.</p>
<p>We aimed to address both of these problems by creating a low-cost, distributed IOT sensor network. The stream monitoring system consists of one or more sensing units that communicate over cellular data to a central server. A cellular enabled microcontroller coordinates input from the various sensors. A laser time of flight (ToF) sensor is mounted towards the surface of the water to measure changes in gauge. These components are mounted in a 3D printed, weather-proof case about 30 cm above the highest expected height of the stream. Conductivity and temperature sensors are mounted below the water’s surface.</p>
<p>The sensing unit is designed to use as little power as possible in order to maximize their lifetime. They enter a sleep state for the time between sensor readings and wake once an hour. Then, they connect to a central server via an LTE data connection. The server stores the sensor data in a database and hosts a website to access and analyze historical data.</p>
